## General Information
- count is my target variable.i am tryin to predict the bike shared through my app what will be the count.
- trying to do fit a model for my project using Linear Regression.
- Availability of the shared bike users so we can maximize the profit 
- Bike dataset

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- My model R-Squared value is 0.8009
- temp and ate,p are highly correlated having pearson's r value of 0.99
- temp and atemp are highly correlated with count(dependent variable)
- there can be 2000 values jump in the next year
